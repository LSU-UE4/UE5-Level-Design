Blocking out or **Gray Blocking** a level is standard practice in most level based video game genres.  It allows us to navigate and play through a space to judge game mechanics and decide if the level works or not.  There is no use to adding lots of custom great art, to then realize that the game play does not work as designed.  This allows us to test the interactivity first before adding artwork to a level.

Now the first step before gray blocking is to make a final decision on physics of our main controllable character.  How would I know how to place platforms without knowing how far the player can jump.  We also need a near final camera as it will need to fit or adapt to the environment you set up.  We will do a very quick version of this first step that sometimes takes months/years on novel mechanics design.

The same thing could be true of any other application.  Why not as an architect, build a very simple version of the structure and navigate it first.  See what you like and don't like about your rough draft.  Then when you are happy you can go back to your modelling software and prepare a final detailed structure.

In this case I am envisioning a third person platformer like Matio and we will customize the default settings to alter the behabior to be more appropriate for this genre. Lets take a quick look at defining our paramters"

##### `Step 1.`\|`SUU&G`|:small_blue_diamond:

Now open the **ThirdPersonCharacter** blueprint that you find in **Content | ThirdPersonBP | Blueprints | ThirdPersonCharacter**. Make sure you are in the **Viewport** tab. Now click on the **Camera Boom** component.  It is the parent of the FollowCamera.  This acts as a spring so that when the camera collides with geometry it acts as a spring to keep the camera from going into geometry. This is represented with the **red** arrow in the editor.

##### `Step 2.`\|`FHIU`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

The camera is very tight to the player light an action shooter.  We want a camera that is a bit further away.  In our charactre blueprint there is a boom that adjusts the distance and angle of the camera from the player. Select the **Camera Boom** component.  Change the **Target Arm Length** to a number like `750`.  Then adjust the **Target Offset Z** value to a value like `218`. Now the camera is above and further away but is not rotated facing the player.  Lets fix that.

##### `Step 3.`\|`SUU&G`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:
Now select the **FollowCamera** component and adjust the **Rotation Y** to `345`.  This will pitch the camera down 15 degrees pointing towards the back of the player's head.

##### `Step 4.`\|`SUU&G`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Press **Compile** in the blueprint then run the game and run into the back wall to see that the spring arm stops (and the player sort of disappears).  We will fix that in a later lesson when we dig more into blueprints. For now you can see that our camera is further back and high up looking down at the player.
