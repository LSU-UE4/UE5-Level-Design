# UE4-Intro-To-Level-Design

<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview
* Unreal gives you access to brushes where you can craft the roughing out of a level that is sometimes refered to as *gray blocking*.  This is where a designer lays out the level and figures out the gameplay before it goes to an art team to properly model and create assets.  We will be looking at some of the strategies that go into creating a proper blocked out level.
  

* Tested on UE4 4.26
* Required to install: Github, GitHub Desktop, Git, Git LFS, and Unreal Engine
